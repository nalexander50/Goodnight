# Goodnight

## Overview

Goodnight is a simple macOS utility that lives in the menu bar and easily allows you to create a sleep timer for your Mac! Imagine that you want to watch a Netflix show on your Mac while in bed. If you fall asleep, you don't want your Mac to keep playing Netflix all night long. On your television, you would set a sleep timer. Why not do the same on your Mac? Enter, Goodnight!

#### Amphetamine

Goodnight and its UI was heavily inspired by [Amphetamine](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12)  by **William C. Gustafson**. Amphetamine is a tool that prevents your Mac from sleeping â€” the polar opposite of Goodnight! My thanks to William for creating such a great tool.
